# Octo Preview

A Chrome extension for live previews of Markdown comments on Issues/Pull Requests. *Should* support GitHub Enterprise, but it is currently untested.

## Todo

- Handle GitHub's not-full-page-reload use-case (likely w/ mutation observers)
- Handle page-load use-case (GH gets values from sessionStorage)
